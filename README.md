This tutorial consists of lessons that introduce the Angular concepts you need to know to start coding in Angular.

You can do as many or as few as you would like and you can do them in any order.

Before you start
For the best experience with this tutorial, review these requirements to make sure you have what you need to be successful.

Your experience
The lessons in this tutorial assume that you have experience with the following:

Created an HTML web page by editing the HTML directly.
Programmed web site content in JavaScript.
Read Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) content and understand how selectors are used.
Used command-line instructions to perform tasks on your computer.
Your equipment
These lessons can be completed by using a local installation of the Angular tools or by using StackBlitz in a web browser. Local Angular development can be completed on Windows, MacOS or Linux based systems.

Conceptual preview of your first Angular app
The lessons in this tutorial create an Angular app that lists houses for rent and shows the details of individual houses. This app uses features that are common to many Angular apps.

Perform these steps in a command-line tool on the computer you want to use for this tutorial.

Step 1 - Identify the version of node.js that Angular requires
Angular requires an active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node. Let's confirm your version of node.js. For information about specific version requirements, see the engines property in the package.json file.

From a Terminal window:

Run the following command: node --version
Confirm that the version number displayed meets the requirements.
Step 2 - Install the correct version of node.js for Angular
If you do not have a version of node.js installed, please follow the directions for installation on nodejs.org

Step 3 - Install the latest version of Angular
With node.js and npm installed, the next step is to install the Angular CLI which provides tooling for effective Angular development.

From a Terminal window run the following command: npm install -g @angular/cli.

Step 4 - Install integrated development environment (IDE)
You are free to use any tool you prefer to build apps with Angular. We recommend the following:

Visual Studio Code
As an optional, but recommended step you can further improve your developer experience by installing the Angular Language Service
Lesson review
In this lesson, you learned about the app that you build in this tutorial and prepared your local computer to develop Angular apps.
